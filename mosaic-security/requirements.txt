# Optional dependencies for MOSAIC SSL certificate generation utility
# 
# The generate_certs.py script will work without these if OpenSSL or Java keytool
# are available. Install this if you want to use the Python cryptography fallback:
#
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or install individually:
# pip install cryptography
