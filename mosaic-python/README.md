# MOSAIC Python Implementation

This directory contains the Python implementation of MOSAIC (Model Orchestration & Synthesis for Adaptive Intelligent Computation).

## Overview

The Python implementation provides a complete, production-ready implementation of the MOSAIC framework. A Java implementation is also in development that will replicate the same logical architecture and functionality.

## Technical Documentation

For detailed technical information about how MOSAIC processes work, component architecture, and implementation details, see [TECHNICAL.md](../TECHNICAL.md). This document covers:

- Configuration system and its various aspects
- Models, Sessions, and Plans architecture
- ONNX model representation and predefined models
- Communication and beacon system
- Planning and model runtime strategies
- Data sharding algorithms

If you want to delve deeper into the technical architecture and understand how each component works, [TECHNICAL.md](../TECHNICAL.md) provides comprehensive documentation at a logical level.
